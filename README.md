_by Karen Freeman-Smith_

## Various jQuery exercises that were too small for a project of their own.

- make page say what kind of element you click on (index.html)
- play peek-a-boo with a walrus (peek-a-boo.html)
- change background colors (colors.html)
- form letter (letter.html)
- convert to uppercase (upper.html)
